# Towards fast ECC signing algorithms for Blockchain
In this project, we present the two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are most used in applications based on blockchain technology and others (see ECDSA and EdDSA file). We also programmed it in Pythton.
This work is a sequel to the paper in which the most effective scalar multiplication and modular multiplicative inverse algorithms for speeding up the signature and verification processes of the two algorithms were presented, which was discussed in NISS22 Conference.
